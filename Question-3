A branch is like a snapshot of code. In other words, you can split your program into several branches which will allow you to work on different pieces of code at the same time without causing any harm on each other.
The default branch will always be set to 'master' and so this will always point to the very last commit you made. If you then want to view a different piece of code you created i.e. an earlier commit you made then you would effectiely need to
switch branches and direct it to an earlier commit using its hash value. At this point the branch is no longer at master but instead at an earlier commit you made.
